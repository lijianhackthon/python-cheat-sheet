## ch1 The way of the program
- The way of thinking like a computer scientist combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
  - Like mathematics, computer scientist use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations).
  - Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives
  - Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions

- The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving.
  - Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately.

- Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations

- When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called **parsing**

- The structure of a program is important. So it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure.


## ch2 Variables, expressions and statements
- type('Hello World!') # will output <type 'str'>
- state diagram shows what state each of the variables is in
- python 2 has 31 keywords:
    - and  as  assert  break  class  continue  def  del  elif  else  except  exec  finally  for  from  global  if  import  in  is  lambda  not  or  pass  print  raise  return  try  while  with  yield
- An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable.
- A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can excute.
- Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.
- When operands of '+' are strings, it applies concatenation; When operands of '\*' are strings, it performs repetition. If one of the operands is a string, the other has to be an integer
- Variables names are case sensitive
